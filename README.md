# netherpurge

Made Netherpurge while experimenting on new techniques for navbars and CSS3 animations. The small line that pops up on hover was made with pseudo elements (::before & ::after). Used span tags to create different effects within lines of text, linear gradients, and using transparency were among other things I practiced while creating Netherpurge.
